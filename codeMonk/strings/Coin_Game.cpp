/*

   Charlie and Alan have challenged each other to a game of logic with coins.

   The game consists of N piles of coins with each pile consisting of  coins. The game progresses as follows: in each turn a player selects any of the piles with even number of coins and removes exactly the half the coins out of that pile. The game ends when a player can't make a move. The last move is a winning move.

   Charlie makes the first move. Assuming both players play optimally, predict who wins the game.

   Input
   The first line consists of the number of test cases T ().

   Each test case consists of two lines.

   The first line in each test case contains the single integer N () â€” the number of piles of coins.

   The second line contains N space separated integers  (), specifying number of coins in piles.

   Output
   Output T lines.

   For each case, output "Charlie" (without quotes) if Charlie wins the game, and "Alan"(without quotes) if Alan wins the game.

   SAMPLE INPUT

   2 4 2

   2 2
   SAMPLE OUTPUT 
   Alan
   Alan
   Explanation
   First case: Following are moves by players in their turns:

   1) Charlie selects the first pile. After that number of coins in piles are : 1 4 2 
   2) Alan selects the third pile. After that number of coins in piles are : 1 4 1 
   3) Charlie selects the second pile. After that number of coins in piles are : 1 2 1 
   4) Alan selects the second pile. After that number of coins in piles are : 1 1 1 

   No further moves possible. Alan wins
